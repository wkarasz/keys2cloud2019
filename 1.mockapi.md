# Mock API

## Overview
In this hands-on lab you will create a mock API for passengers.  it’s really a good idea to fake it before you make it.  Teams can create mock services to indicated what they need an API to do.  Architects and developers can get a head start on their work by leveraging the Mock API well before the implemented API goes into production; Can also provide feedback and changes earlier in the API development lifecycle. Supports continues planning, development and testing.

### Get Started
Start by having your API Specs group CustomerExperienceAirport open.  There are many ways to open your spec group.  Here are the steps starting from at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.

1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.
2)	Select Integration.
3)	Select Flogo.
4)	Select API specs CustomerExperienceAirport.

### Create Mock App
We are now going to create a mock application for passengers from your passenger API spec.

1)	Navigate to passengers, hover over passengers in the API spec list, select … and choose Create Mock app.
2)	Give your mock app a name, v2_passengers and select Create.
3)	Your mock app v2_passengers will be created and deployed to the cloud.
  
### Test
This next section will show you how to test your mock application end points.

1)	Select the down-arrow next to 1 Endpoint and choose view and test.
2)	Select Try it out! Under GET /v2/passengers.
3)	Your request for passengers will return a list of passengers.
4)	Let’s try testing /v2/passengers/{passengerid}.  Select or scroll down to /v2/passengers/{passengerid}.  Enter 11111 in passengerid parameter and select Try it out!
5)	Your request for /v2/passengers/11111 will return passenger details.
  
### Summary
Creating Mock Apps is as simple as a mouse click on TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud.  In this section we leveraged the passengers API and generated and deployed a mock passengers app to the cloud and tested the API end point.
