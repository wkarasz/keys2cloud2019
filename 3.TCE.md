# Cloud Events

## Overview

In this hands-on lab you will use Cloud Events to create a dynamic API that will respond with contextual offers.  Cloud Events will make decisions based on itineraries, gate information, flight status and passenger profile.  Cloud Events will respond with the best possible offer for the passenger.   

## Get Started

Start by signing into TIBCO Cloud and opening Events.

1)	Start at Welcome to your TIBCO Cloud.
2)	Select Event Processing.
3)	Select Events.

Uploading Cloud Event Offer Project

For this exercise we are going to start with a prebuilt solution.  This solution will make an offer decision based on passenger loyalty and flight status. 

1)	The You don’t have any apps yet page should be opened.
2)	Select Upload, cloud with up-arrow.
3)	Navigate to where you extracted the connected customer experience artifacts and drag CustomerExperienceAirport/CloudEvents/PassengerOffer.ear into Drag and Drop and select Push. 
<br>Or download [PassengerOffer.ear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkarasz/keys2cloud2019/master/project/cloudevents/PassengerOffer.ear)
4)	The PassegerOffer project files will be pushed to the cloud and started.

## Testing  PassengerOffer

1)	The PassengerOffer project should be running.
2)	Select **2 Endpoints** and choose PassengerOffer Swagger link.
3)	Expand GET Method and select Try it out.
4)	Enter values for parameters as shown below and press Execute.
5)	The offer, shown below, is Dinner At Chilis.
6)	Try a couple of different combinations of loyalty status and flight status. Use values in the table below.

| passengerid |	loyaltystatus |	flightstatus |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 11111 | BRONZE | DELAY1 |
| 11111 | SILVER |DELAY1 |
| 11111	| GOLD | DELAY1 |
| 11111	| BRONZE | DELAY2 |
| 11111	| SILVER | DELAY2 |
| 11111	| GOLD | DELAY2 |
| 11111	| BRONZE | DELAY3 |
| 11111	| SILVER | DELAY3 |
| 11111 | GOLD | DELAY3 |

## Working with Cloud Events

In this next section we are going to make a change to the decision table.  Currently a passenger with GOLD loyalty and a 2-hour delayed flight is offered a Happy Meal.  We are going to change that offer to a Philly Cheesesteak and Coke.

1.	Navigate to Cloud Events Apps page by Logging into cloud.tibco.com and select Event Processing and select Events.  You should see your running PassengerOffer App.
2.	You are going to use WebStudio to make changes to the Cloud Events decision table.  But before you can do this, the app needs to be moved to an operational sandbox and provisioned to WebStudio.
	1.	Click on dropdown for *Apps in* sandbox field, and click on *+ New*.  Create operation sandbox. Give your operational sandbox a name, e.g. *live*, and click create.
	2.	From your running PassengerOffer App, select Promote to an operational sandbox.  Choose your Operational sandbox and click on Promote App.  (A new copy of the App is being created and will take a  minute to deploy).
	3.	On your Operational app, Select Provision App to WebStudio from the dropdown and wait for dialog indicating the provisioning was successful.  Scale up the App, if not started.
3.	Select WebStudio. Navigate to Dashboard.  The dashboard shows all recent activities.  Navigate to Workspace.  We are going to check out project artifacts and make changes. Select +.
4.	Select PassengerOffer and select Confirm.  This will check out all PassengerOffer artifacts.
5.	You are going to make changes to the PassengerOffer decision table.  Select offerDecision from ARTIFACTS list.
6.	In the offerDecision table scroll down to row 6 where SILVER, DELAY2 and “Happy Meal” is displayed.  Change “Happy Meal” to “Philly Cheesesteak and Coke”.  Select Save.
	1.	Commit your changes.  Select Commit, add a message and select Confirm.
7.	Select show resources as tree.
8.	Right-click on PassengerOffer and select Generate Deployable. Select PassengerOffer and select Confirm.
9.	Let’s deploy the changes.  Select Dashboard, select >PassengerOffer from recent activity and select Approve and then Deploy.  Wait for dialog confirming successful deployment.

## Testing PassengerOffer Changes

1)	Navigate to Cloud Events Apps and select 2 Endpoint PassengerOffer - /swagger.
2)	Expand GET Method and select Try it out.
3)	Enter values for parameters as shown below and press Execute.
4)	The offer, shown below, is Philly Cheesesteak and Coke.

## Summary
In this exercise you imported a cloud events project, made changes to decision tables and tested PassengerOffer API.
